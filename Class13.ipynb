    "Inverted threshold binary is another type of thresholding technique in image processing, but it works in the opposite way to the regular binary thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with binary thresholding, we begin with a grayscale image where each pixel's value ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white).\n",
    "We choose a threshold value again, let's say 127 for consistency.\n",
    "For each pixel, we compare its value with the threshold.\n",
    "If the pixel's value is greater than the threshold, instead of setting it to the maximum value (white), we set it to 0 (black). This is the \"inverted\" part – it's the opposite of what we do in regular binary thresholding.\n",
    "If the pixel's value is less than or equal to the threshold, we set it to the maximum value (white), again the opposite of the binary thresholding.\n",
    "The resulting image will have white pixels where the original image was dark (below or equal to the threshold) and black pixels where the original image was light (above the threshold).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, inverted threshold binary flips the colors of the output image from the standard binary thresholding method. Dark areas become light, and light areas become dark. This method can be helpful when the features of interest are darker than the background, and you want them to stand out as white in the processed image."

    "Choose a threshold value, say 127.\n",

    "If a pixel's value is greater than the threshold, instead of setting it to a maximum value like in binary thresholding, you \"truncate\" it, which means you set it to the threshold value itself. In our example, any pixel value above 127 would be set to exactly 127.\n",
    "If a pixel's value is less than or equal to the threshold, it remains unchanged.\n",
